# hematite_server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PistonDevelopers/hematite_server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PistonDevelopers/hematite_server)

This is the [Hematite][] server, an implementation of the [Minecraft][] server in [Rust][]. Some of our [goals](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/hematite_server/issues/3) are:

*   feature parity with the “Notchian” vanilla server,
*   increased performance,
*   and support for server mods written in Rust.

The Hematite server is currently in very early stages of development and completely unusable.
